## 11. ⚠️ Known Issues / Notes

### Current State
1. PostgreSQL connection health at 50% (idle connections present from previous test)
   - **Action**: Can be cleared via Reset button or trigger new bloat test

2. API endpoint structure
   - Backend uses Go with Gin framework
   - Some endpoints return 404 if not properly routed

### For GKE Deployment
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - `APP_PASSWORD` - Frontend authentication
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` - AI diagnosis (Groq)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - AI diagnosis fallback (Gemini)
   - Database connection strings

2. **Ports to Expose**:
   - Frontend: 3000
   - Backend: 8080
   - AI Diagnosis: 8000
   - Health Monitor: 8002

3. **Persistent Volumes Needed**:
   - PostgreSQL data
   - (Optional) Mock system data if persistence desired

4. **Resource Requirements**:
   - Frontend: Minimal (Nginx static files)
   - Backend: Low (Go binary)
   - AI Diagnosis: Low (Python FastAPI)
   - Health Monitor: Low (Python Flask)
   - PostgreSQL: Medium (database)
   - Mock systems: Minimal

- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Environment variable secrets (not hardcoded)
- ✅ No API keys in codebase
- ✅ Password reveal toggle
- ✅ Agent actions limited to pre-defined commands

**Recommended Pre-Deployment Actions:**
1. Run `Reset All` to clear test data
2. Set production `APP_PASSWORD` in `.env`
3. Verify `GROQ_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` are valid
4. Test on clean state to ensure incident generation works
5. Document GKE deployment configuration

**GKE Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Create GKE cluster
- [ ] Set up Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL (or use StatefulSet)
- [ ] Configure secrets for API keys and passwords
- [ ] Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress)
- [ ] Set up persistent volumes for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Configure health checks and liveness probes
- [ ] Set resource limits and requests
- [ ] Test with port-forward before exposing publicly
- [ ] Configure ingress/load balancer
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
