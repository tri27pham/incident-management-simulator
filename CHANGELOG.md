### üîß Backend Enhancements

#### New Services
- **Agent Service**: Core remediation workflow orchestration
- **Safety Service**: Permission and safety rule enforcement
- **System Registry**: Whitelist of actionable systems

#### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/incidents/:id/agent/remediate` - Start agent remediation
- `GET /api/v1/agent/executions/:id` - Get execution details
- `GET /api/v1/incidents/:id/agent/executions` - Get all executions for incident
- `POST /api/v1/agent/executions/:id/approve` - Approve pending execution
- `POST /api/v1/agent/executions/:id/reject` - Reject pending execution
- `POST /api/v1/reset` - Database reset with frontend broadcast

#### AI Integration
- New `/api/v1/agent-think` endpoint in ai-diagnosis service
- Constrained AI prompts to only recommend implemented actions
- Support for Groq and Gemini models

### üíæ Database Changes

#### New Table: `agent_executions`
- Comprehensive tracking of all agent activities
- Multi-phase status tracking
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage (commands, risks, logs, verification)
- Complete audit trail with timestamps
- Success/failure tracking and error messages
- Rollback tracking (infrastructure ready)

#### Extended `incidents` Table
- `incident_type VARCHAR(50)` - Classification of incident
- `actionable BOOLEAN` - Can agents act on this?
- `affected_systems TEXT[]` - Array of impacted systems
- `remediation_mode VARCHAR(50)` - How to remediate
- `metadata JSONB` - Flexible additional data

#### Custom GORM Types
- `StringArray` for PostgreSQL `TEXT[]` arrays
- `JSONB` for PostgreSQL JSONB with proper marshaling/unmarshaling

### üè• System Monitoring

#### Health Monitor Service
- Continuous Redis memory monitoring
- Automatic incident creation when Redis exceeds thresholds
- Proper incident classification for agent compatibility
- Integration with agent service for command execution

#### UI Features
- System health dashboard with Redis metrics
- "Trigger Failure" button to simulate Redis overload
- Real-time health updates via polling
- Visual progress bar during failure simulation

### üîÑ Database Reset Improvements

#### Script Enhancements (`scripts/reset-db.sh`)
- Stops all services before clearing database
- Uses `TRUNCATE TABLE` with `RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE`
- Restarts services after reset
- Broadcasts reset event to frontend clients
- More reliable than previous DROP/CREATE approach

#### Frontend Reset Button
- Clears Redis memory
- Calls backend reset endpoint
- Backend truncates all tables
- Frontend receives WebSocket notification and clears UI
- Fixed duplicate `/api/v1` path issue

### üêõ Bug Fixes

1. **GORM JSONB Scanning**: Fixed custom types to handle both objects and arrays
2. **WebSocket Status Updates**: Corrected incident status mapping for real-time updates
3. **Database Reset**: Fixed script to properly clear all data and stop services
4. **Frontend Reset URL**: Fixed duplicate `/api/v1` in reset endpoint call
5. **React Rendering**: Fixed execution logs rendering with proper type checking
6. **Z-index Issues**: Corrected overlapping UI elements in resolved panel
7. **Event Propagation**: Fixed click events bubbling in incident cards

### üß™ Testing

#### New Scripts
- `scripts/test-agent.sh` - End-to-end agent workflow test
- `scripts/break-redis-fast.sh` - Quickly creates Redis incident for testing
- `scripts/start-docker.sh` - Simplified Docker Compose startup
- `scripts/stop-docker.sh` - Clean Docker Compose shutdown

### üìö Documentation

#### New Documentation
- `AI_AGENT_README.md` - Complete AI agent system documentation
- Comprehensive PR description in markdown format
- Updated main `README.md` with AI agent features
- Updated `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with new commands and troubleshooting

#### Documentation Improvements
- Architecture diagrams
- API documentation
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations
- Extension guide for new actions
- Quick test walkthrough

### üîí Security Features

1. **Triple Verification**: Incident must be `actionable`, `real_system`, and `automated`
2. **System Whitelist**: Only explicitly allowed systems in registry
3. **User Approval**: Manual approval required before execution
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all agent actions in database
5. **Verification**: Always checks if remediation actually worked
6. **Rollback Ready**: Infrastructure for future rollback capability

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

#### Environment Variables
- `HEALTH_MONITOR_URL` - Backend connection to health monitor service
- `VITE_API_URL` - Frontend API endpoint configuration

#### Docker Compose Updates
- Added health monitor service
- Added Redis test instance
- Network configuration for inter-service communication
- Build arguments for frontend configuration

### üöÄ Performance & Reliability

- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Connection pooling for health checks
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Automatic WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff
- Polling with configurable intervals (2s for agent executions)

### üìà Metrics & Monitoring

- Agent execution success/failure rates tracked in database
- Complete execution logs for debugging
- Verification check results stored for analysis
- Timeline tracking for performance monitoring

## Migration Notes

### Database Migrations Required
```bash
./scripts/run-migrations.sh
```

### Docker Compose Changes
```bash
# Rebuild all services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Environment Variables to Add
```env
HEALTH_MONITOR_URL=http://health-monitor:8002
```

## Breaking Changes

None - All changes are additive. Existing functionality remains unchanged.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting database migrations (keep `agent_executions` table for audit)
2. Redeploying previous Docker images
3. Existing incidents and functionality continue to work

The agent system is completely opt-in and doesn't affect non-agent workflows.
