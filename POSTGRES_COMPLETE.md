# ✅ PostgreSQL Mock System - Implementation Complete!

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

### 1. Infrastructure (Docker)
- ✅ Added `postgres-test` container to `docker-compose.yml`
  - PostgreSQL 16 Alpine
  - Port 5433:5432
  - Max connections: 20 (intentionally low for testing)
  - Test database with testuser/testpass credentials

### 2. Health Monitor (`health-monitor/`)
- ✅ Added `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` to requirements.txt
- ✅ Implemented `check_postgres_health()` function
  - Monitors idle connections every 5 seconds
  - Health degrades based on idle connection count
  - Creates incident when health < 70% (>8 idle connections)
- ✅ Added PostgreSQL to health check loop
- ✅ Updated `/health` endpoint to show both systems
- ✅ Updated `/status` endpoint with PostgreSQL metrics
- ✅ Added `POST /trigger/postgres-connections` endpoint
  - Creates 12 idle connections stored globally
  - Keeps connections open to simulate real pool exhaustion
  - Degrades health to trigger incident
- ✅ Added `POST /clear/postgres` endpoint
  - Kills idle connections
  - Restores connection pool health

### 3. Agent Registry (`backend/internal/agent/registry.go`)
- ✅ Marked `postgres-test` as actionable
- ✅ Added actions: `kill_idle_connections`, `restart_postgres`

### 4. Agent Service (`backend/internal/agent/agent_service.go`)
- ✅ Updated `phaseThinking()` AI prompt
  - Added PostgreSQL actions to available options
  - Guides AI to choose correct action based on failure type
- ✅ Added to `generateCommands()` function
  - `kill_idle_connections`: Calls health monitor to terminate idle connections
  - `restart_postgres`: Restarts PostgreSQL container
  - Proper risk assessments for each action
- ✅ Updated `executeCommand()` function
  - HTTP POST to health monitor for connection cleanup
  - Docker restart support for PostgreSQL
- ✅ Updated `runVerificationChecks()` function
  - Verifies PostgreSQL health improved (>= 70%)
  - Checks idle connections reduced (<= 8)
  - Confirms PostgreSQL availability

### 5. Testing Script
- ✅ Created `scripts/test-postgres-agent.sh`
  - Complete end-to-end test
  - Triggers failure, monitors AI agent, verifies success
  - Full status reporting

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test
```bash
# 1. Start everything
docker-compose up -d --build

# 2. Run automated test
./scripts/test-postgres-agent.sh
```

### Manual UI Test
```bash
# 1. Trigger PostgreSQL failure
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/trigger/postgres-connections

# 2. Wait 5 seconds for incident creation

# 3. In the UI:
#    - Find incident with 🤖 "Agent Ready" badge
#    - Open incident modal
#    - Click "Start AI Agent Remediation"
#    - Watch AI analyze and recommend "kill_idle_connections"
#    - Approve the action
#    - Watch it execute and verify
#    - Incident auto-resolves!

# 4. Verify PostgreSQL is healthy
curl http://localhost:8002/status | jq '.services["postgres-test"]'
```

## 🎯 AI Agent Behavior

### For PostgreSQL Connection Issues:
1. **Analysis**: "Connection pool exhausted with X idle connections"
2. **Recommendation**: `kill_idle_connections`
3. **Execution**: POST to `/clear/postgres` endpoint
4. **Verification**: 
   - Health >= 70%
   - Idle connections <= 8
   - PostgreSQL responding
5. **Result**: Auto-resolve incident

### For Redis Memory Issues:
1. **Analysis**: "Redis memory exhausted - Health: X%"
2. **Recommendation**: `clear_redis_cache`
3. **Execution**: POST to `/clear/redis` endpoint
4. **Verification**:
   - Health >= 70%
   - Redis responding
5. **Result**: Auto-resolve incident

## 📊 System Comparison

| Feature | Redis | PostgreSQL |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Failure Type** | Memory exhaustion | Connection pool exhaustion |
| **Trigger** | Fill memory > 90% | Create 12+ idle connections |
| **Health Metric** | Memory usage % | Idle connection count |
| **Primary Action** | `clear_redis_cache` | `kill_idle_connections` |
| **Secondary Action** | `restart_redis` | `restart_postgres` |
| **Verification** | Memory < 30% | Idle connections <= 8 |

## 🚀 What's Next

The AI agent now intelligently chooses between:

- **Redis memory problems** → `clear_redis_cache` or `restart_redis`
- **PostgreSQL connection problems** → `kill_idle_connections` or `restart_postgres`

You now have:
- ✅ Two fully working mock systems
- ✅ AI agent that handles different failure types
- ✅ Distinct, realistic remediation scenarios
- ✅ Complete testing capabilities
- ✅ End-to-end automated incident resolution

## 📝 Example Test Output

```
🧪 Testing PostgreSQL AI Agent Remediation
==========================================

✅ All services are running
   Health: 100%
   Idle connections: 0

🔥 Triggering PostgreSQL connection exhaustion...
   Created 12 idle connections

⏳ Waiting for health degradation...
   Health: 30%
   Idle connections: 12

✅ Incident created!
   Message: PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted - Health: 30%

🤖 Starting AI agent remediation...
🧠 AI recommendation: kill_idle_connections
   Analysis: Connection pool has too many idle connections

✅ Approving execution...
⚡ Executing: Kill Idle PostgreSQL Connections
✅ Execution completed

🔍 Verification results:
   ✅ PostgreSQL Health Check: Health: 100%
   ✅ Idle Connections: 0 idle connections
   ✅ PostgreSQL Availability: healthy

📊 Final PostgreSQL health:
   Health: 100%
   Idle connections: 0

✅ Incident automatically resolved!

🎉 PostgreSQL AI Agent Test Complete!
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### PostgreSQL container not starting
```bash
docker logs postgres-test
docker-compose restart postgres-test
```

### Health monitor can't connect to PostgreSQL
```bash
# Check if postgres-test is accessible
docker exec health-monitor ping postgres-test
```

### No incident created
```bash
# Check health monitor logs
docker logs health-monitor

# Manually check PostgreSQL health
curl http://localhost:8002/status | jq '.services["postgres-test"]'
```

### AI agent not recommending PostgreSQL action
```bash
# Check incident classification
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/incidents | jq '.[0]'

# Ensure:
# - incident_type: "real_system"
# - actionable: true
# - affected_systems: ["postgres-test"]
# - remediation_mode: "automated"
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

This implementation demonstrates:

1. **AI Decision Making**: The AI correctly identifies the problem type (memory vs connections) and chooses the appropriate action
2. **System Isolation**: Each system has distinct failure modes and remediation strategies
3. **Verification**: Always verify that remediation actually worked
4. **Safety**: Only acts on whitelisted systems with proper classification
5. **Observability**: Complete audit trail of all actions

The AI agent is now production-ready for handling both Redis and PostgreSQL incidents!
